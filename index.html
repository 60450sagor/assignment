      <p class="p-middle">
        Save the Children was the first global organization devoted solely to
        serving children's needs, protecting them from harm and securing their
        rights. Today, we champion the rights of the world's 2.3 billion
        children. <br /><br />
        As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread globally, hundreds of
        millions of children face increasing threats to their safety and
        wellbeing - including violence, gender-based violence, exploitation and
        separation from caregivers. These threats could be even more severe for
        children living in countries experiencing instability and conflict.
        <br /><br />
        We know the world's children deserve better. Our 100-year history of
        responding to emergencies has given us the expertise and the global
        presence to deliver what's needed now for children.
